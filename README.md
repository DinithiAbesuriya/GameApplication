# GameApplication
This project was developed as part of an assignment for the Comparative Integrated Systems module at the University of Bedfordshire (UOB). The application comprises three distinct games, each designed to engage users in different challenges.
## Smile Game: Mathematical Challenge
In the Smile Game, users face a mathematical challenge adorned with a cheerful smile emoji.
Their objective is to calculate and provide the precise numerical value to correctly solve the presented mathematical question. This game not only tests users' mathematical skills but also their ability to apply logic and calculations effectively.

## Title Matching Game: Memory Test
The Title Matching Game is a memory-based challenge.
Users are tasked with matching titles, which often involves matching a set of items with their corresponding titles. This game assesses users' memory and their capacity to recall and associate titles with their respective items, making it an engaging exercise for enhancing memory skills.

## Emoji Game: Word Association Challenge
In the Emoji Game, participants engage in a guessing challenge based on a series of emojis.
Their objective is to deduce the word or phrase that corresponds to the provided emojis. This game assesses users' ability to associate visual symbols with language, enhancing their word association skills and creative thinking.
